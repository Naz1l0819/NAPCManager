      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        We’re a small, legally-acknowledged cluster of humans who weaponize sarcasm to build digital
        products. We like clean code, faster shipping, and coffee done right. We dislike bloated
        enterprise nonsense and bland corporate speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our workflow: think → overthink → build → refine → pretend it was effortless. If you want
        marketing fluff, look elsewhere. If you want shipping momentum with a side of audacity,
        you’re home.
